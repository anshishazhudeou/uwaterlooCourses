# README

These samples demonstrate how to build and run a project using gradle. They assume that you alfready have gradle installed on your system, and in the system path (i.e. you can type the command `gradle' in a shell and have it work properly). 

If you need to install gradle, you can download it from https://gradle.org. 

The user manual and documentation can be viewed at https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html.

With each sample you should be able to type

* `gradle build' to build the code
* `gradle run' to execute it
* `gradle clean' to remove the intermediate files
