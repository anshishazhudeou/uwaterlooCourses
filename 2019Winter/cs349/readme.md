# CS 349 Lecture Notes & Examples

All the slides and sample code used in lectures will be posted to this repository. You should `git clone` this entire repository, and then `git pull` before each lecture. The code will likely be updated for bugs and improvements, so this way you'll always have the most up-to-date version.

See the [course website](https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs349/w19) for the syllabus, and course schedule.
