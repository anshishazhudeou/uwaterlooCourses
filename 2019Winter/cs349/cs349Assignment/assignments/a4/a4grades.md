Notes:   

## Deliverables (5%)

1. [5/5] Code compiles and runs in Android Studio, using the Pixel AVD with API 26.			

## Basic requirements (10%)

2. [4/4] The application consists of a single screen with an image grid and a main toolbar.

3. [6/6] There are clear mechanisms to clear the images, load a set of images, and filter images. These can appear on the main toolbar or a secondary toolbar.

## Screen layout (35%)

4. [10/10] Horizontal Layout shows a fixed number of columns (2 or more). No horizontal bar should appear.

5. [10/10] Vertical Layout shows a single column. No horizontal bar should appear.

6. [5/5] Layout can be automatically switched based on the phone's orientation.

7. [5/5] The "Ratings" widget appears in the grid below each image.

8. [5/5] The interface design is aesthetic (the layout is functional and pleasant, good images were used for the widgets, etc.).

## Images (30%)

9. [8/10] The "Load Images" button should clear the grid and ratings. It should also load 10 images from the website and display them in the grid.

-2  The filter setting is not cleared before the new images are loaded.

10. [10/10] The application should support loading and displaying multiple formats, including JPG and PNG.

11. [5/5] Images are reasonably sizes for the device and orientation. Images should be scaled to be visible, but do NOT need to be scaled to the same size.

12. [5/5] Selecting an image shows an enlarged image. There is a way of dismissing this image.

## Ranking (20%)

14. [5/5] Individual images can be ranked by changing the rating for the image.

15. [10/10] The ratings filter on the toolbar filters out the images that don't meet the specified rating or higher.

16. [5/5] Changing the rating of an image should immediately be reflected in the list (i.e. if it no longer meets the filter criteria, it should disappear).
